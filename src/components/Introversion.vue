        | I have always been an introvert at heart. While definitions of "introvert" and "extrovert" vary, the core difference was first captured by Carl Jung,
        | who argued that "Each person seems to be energized more by either the external world (extraversion) or the internal world (introversion)."
        | Later thinkers have clarified that the essential difference stems from the degree of energy that one draws from social interactions.
        | Here are my thoughts on being an introvert in an extrovert's world.

        ol(class="principles-ol")
          li(class="principles-li") Everyone deserves to be heard; every voice matters.
          li(class="principles-li") The frequency of contributions in a conversation, be it personal or professional, matters far less than the quality of contributions.
          li(class="principles-li") Merit of argument matters far more than personal style.
