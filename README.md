# Portfolio Site 2.0

This is a redo from the ground up of my original portfolio site (no link here out of embarrassment :)). While the first site was a valiant effort given my skills at the time, I can do better now. This site aims to be much more simple but also more elegant than the first one. It no doubt pales in comparison to what I will be able to do a year or two (or five) from now, but it represents a major step forward from last time.

Built using the Vue CLI starter kit, SASS, and Pug.
